## Full Description

### Welcome to Lego City!

Transform your factory into a thriving city with the **Lego City Mod**! This mod seamlessly blends city simulation gameplay with Factorio's core automation, creating a unique experience where your citizens work alongside your machines.

### Core Features

🏙️ **City Management**
- Build and manage city buildings (City Hall, Houses, Market, Furnaces)
- Population quota system based on building count
- Plan your city layout for optimal efficiency

👷 **Lego Citizens System**
- Recruit citizens to work in your furnaces
- Citizens act as catalysts for smelting (not consumed, only stamina reduced)
- Manage citizen stamina - tired citizens need rest in houses
- Full automation support with belts and inserters

💰 **Economic Loop**
- Produce items with citizens
- Sell items at the Market for money
- Use money to recruit more citizens
- Complete self-sustaining economic cycle

🔬 **Tech Integration**
- All technologies require vanilla science packs
- Fully integrated with base game tech tree
- No disruption to vanilla gameplay
- Compatible with Space Age DLC

### How It Works

1. **Research City Settlement** (Red Science ×30) to unlock City Hall and Houses
2. **Build your city** - Place buildings to increase population quota
3. **Recruit citizens** - Exchange products for money, then recruit citizens
4. **Set up production** - Citizens work in Lego Furnaces to smelt materials
5. **Automate the loop** - Citizens get tired, rest in houses, then return to work
6. **Expand** - Research new techs to unlock more buildings and increase capacity

### Key Buildings
